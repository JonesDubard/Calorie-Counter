# Calories Counter Project

This project was completed as part of a guided project on FreeCodeCamp. The primary goal was to explore basic HTML and CSS concepts while also challenging oneself with JavaScript concepts, particularly through form validation and creating a Calories Counter.

## Project Overview

The Calories Counter project is a web application designed to help users track their daily calorie intake. It allows users to input the amount of calories consumed for each meal and displays the total calorie count for the day. Additionally, the application provides basic form validation to ensure that users enter valid numerical values for calorie input.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used to create the structure and content of the web page.
- CSS: Used for styling and layout design to enhance the visual appearance of the application.
- JavaScript: Used to implement the interactive features of the application, such as form validation and calorie calculation.

## Key Features

- Calorie Input Form: Users can input the number of calories consumed for each meal using a simple form.
- Form Validation: Basic form validation ensures that users enter valid numerical values for calorie input.
- Calorie Calculation: The application calculates and displays the total calorie count for the day based on the input provided by the user.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Use the provided form to input the number of calories consumed for each meal.
4. Click the "Calculate Remaining Calories" button to calculate and display the total calorie count.

## Project Reflection

This project provided an opportunity to practice and solidify basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts while also exploring form validation and interactive features in web development. By building a Calories Counter application, I gained hands-on experience in creating dynamic web applications and learned how to implement basic user input validation.
